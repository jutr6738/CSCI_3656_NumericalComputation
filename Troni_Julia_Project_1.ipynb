    "\n",
    "- Ultimately concluded that I am not a magician so I cannot trick the computer into having infinite storage capacity \n",
    "- What I did learn:\n",
    "    - Floating point operations can be really dangerous depending on how they are used/what they are used for because of these storage and rounding errors\n",
    "        - This has really got my mind thinking and I will now be on the lookout for it and I am interested to find ways to \"avoid\" this\n",
    "    - I forgot how neat Computer Systems is and man I was quite rusty\n",
    "    - Python has a lot of really neat libraries and methods and I learned how to add more packages to my jupyter kernel \n",
    "    - Also:\n",
    "        - I tried to set cut off timers for myself of 2 hours per day for max of 8 hours on this because I knew I would spend far too long investigating this considering I have many other assignments to do. However, like usual I was not successful in sticking to this, but will try again next time \n",
